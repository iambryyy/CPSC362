# Contact App
For this ContactBook App, we will be developing a program that is similar to that of the Contacts App on iOS devices. 
This will have features such as having notes for the contact as well as having email, pronouns, url, birthday, social profile, and address.

Along with these features, we will also implement a Geolocation feature that will pull an API request to obtain the contact's city
from their area code.

Another feature we will implement will be to send an SMS notification to let other contacts know they have been added to your Contact Book.

Screenshot as of 09/21/23 -- Next will be implementing current Contacts and displaying on the side of pop up window
